For Automation I used the "Mocha framework with chai assertion library"
In the "Fixture folder", I  store test data.
In "e2e folder" I make two folder BackEndPages & FrontEndPages folder. 
In the BackEndPages folder, I store API testing-related reusable functions.
In the FrontEndPages folder, I store UI testing-related reusable functions & locators.
